* launch
==> cython
cython is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because this formula is mainly used internally by other formulae.
Users are advised to use `pip` to install cython.

If you need to have cython first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/cython/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

==> cassandra
To have launchd start cassandra now and restart at login:
  brew services start cassandra
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  cassandra -f
