** Binary Tree
A binary tree have benefits of both an ordered array and a linked list as search is as quick as in sorted array and insertion or deletion operation are as fast as in linked list.
** Binary Search Tree
Binary Search tree exhibits a special behaviour. A node's left child must have value less than its parent's value and node's right child must have value greater than it's parent value.

#+BEGIN_SRC C
  struct node {
    int data;   
    struct node *leftChild;
    struct node *rightChild;
  };
#+END_SRC
